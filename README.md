## 1\. Project Overview

**Goal:** The objective of this project is to build a deep learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Dataset:** The project uses the `creditcard.csv` dataset, which contains transactions made by European cardholders. It includes 30 numerical features: `Time`, `Amount`, and 28 anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`) obtained through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The target variable, `Class`, is binary, where `1` indicates a fraudulent transaction and `0` indicates a legitimate one.

**Approach:**

1.  **Explore and preprocess** the data to handle issues like duplicates and feature scaling.
2.  Address the significant **class imbalance** in the dataset using the **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)**.
3.  Build and train a simple **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.
4.  Experiment with different **activation functions** (`ReLU`, `tanh`) and **optimizers** (`Adam`, `RMSProp`, `SGD`) to find the best-performing combination.
5.  Develop a function to predict the class of a new, unseen transaction.

-----

## 2\. Environment Setup

This section covers the initial setup required to run the notebook in a Google Colab environment.

### 2.1. Mounting Google Drive

The first step is to mount Google Drive to access the dataset and save the notebook.

```python
# mount drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

  * `from google.colab import drive`: Imports the necessary library from Colab.
  * `drive.mount(...)`: Mounts your Google Drive at the specified path `/content/drive`, allowing the notebook to access its files.

### 2.2. Changing Directory

After mounting the drive, we navigate to the specific project folder where the dataset and notebook are located.

```python
# change directory
import os
os.chdir("/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Fraud Detection")
!ls
```

  * `import os`: Imports the operating system library to interact with the file system.
  * `os.chdir(...)`: Changes the current working directory to the project folder.
  * `!ls`: Lists the files in the current directory to confirm we are in the right place.

### 2.3. Importing Libraries

Here, we import all the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, preprocessing, and model building.

```python
# Data and visualization libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Scikit-learn for preprocessing and metrics
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Imblearn for handling imbalanced data
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# TensorFlow Keras for building the neural network
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD, Adam, RMSprop
```

  * **Pandas & NumPy:** For data loading, manipulation, and numerical operations.
  * **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For plotting and data visualization.
  * **Scikit-learn:** Provides tools for scaling data (`StandardScaler`), splitting data (`train_test_split`), and evaluating the model (`classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`).
  * **Imblearn:** Specifically used for `SMOTE` to correct class imbalance.
  * **TensorFlow Keras:** The deep learning framework used to build the ANN (`Sequential`), add layers (`Dense`), and choose optimization algorithms (`optimizers`).

-----

## 3\. Data Loading and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 3.1. Loading the Dataset

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and we separate the features (X) from the target variable (y).

```python
df = pd.read_csv("./creditcard.csv")
X = df.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = df['Class']
```

  * `pd.read_csv()`: Reads the data from the CSV file into the `df` DataFrame.
  * `X`: Contains all columns from the DataFrame *except* for the `Class` column. These are the input features for the model.
  * `y`: Contains only the `Class` column, which is our target variable for prediction.

### 3.2. Initial Data Inspection

`df.info()` provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the data types of each column and the number of non-null values. `df.shape` gives the dimensions (rows, columns).

```python
df.info()
# Output shows 284,807 entries and 31 columns, all non-null.
df.shape
# Output: (284807, 31)
```

**Insight:** The dataset is large and clean, with no missing values. All features are numerical (`float64` or `int64`).

### 3.3. Statistical Summary

`df.describe()` generates descriptive statistics for each numerical column, such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.

```python
df.describe()
```

**Insight:**

  * The `Amount` feature varies significantly, suggesting that scaling will be necessary.
  * The features `V1` through `V28` are already scaled around zero, which is characteristic of PCA.
  * Looking at the `Class` column, the `mean` is `0.0017`. This indicates that only about **0.17%** of the transactions are fraudulent, confirming a severe **class imbalance**.

-----

## 4\. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

### 4.1. Checking for Missing Values and Duplicates

We explicitly check for any missing values or duplicated rows.

```python
print("Missing Values:\n",df.isnull().sum())
print("Duplicates:",df.duplicated().sum())
```

**Insight:**

  * **Missing Values:** Confirms zero missing values.
  * **Duplicates:** There are **1,081** duplicated rows in the dataset.

### 4.2. Handling Duplicates

While duplicates are often removed, in this case, they are kept. In transactional data, it's possible for legitimate, separate transactions to appear identical (e.g., same amount at the same time from the same terminal). Removing them might discard valuable information. The code below was used to investigate them but they were not removed from `df`.

```python
# Code to investigate duplicates (not used for removal)
duplicate_rows = df[df.duplicated(keep=False)]
duplicate_class_dist = duplicate_rows['Class'].value_counts()
```

**Insight:** The majority of the duplicated rows belong to the non-fraudulent class (`0`).

-----

## 5\. Feature Engineering and Balancing

### 5.1. Feature Scaling

Neural networks perform best when numerical input features are scaled to a standard range. We use `StandardScaler` to normalize the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

  * `StandardScaler()`: Initializes the scaler.
  * `fit_transform(X)`: Computes the mean and standard deviation from the feature data `X` and then applies the transformation.

### 5.2. Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE

To address the severe class imbalance, we use **SMOTE**. SMOTE works by creating synthetic examples of the minority class (fraudulent transactions) instead of just duplicating them. This helps the model learn the characteristics of fraudulent transactions more effectively without becoming biased towards the majority class.

```python
sm = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X_scaled, y)
```

  * `SMOTE()`: Initializes the SMOTE algorithm. `random_state` ensures reproducibility.
  * `fit_resample()`: Applies SMOTE to the scaled features (`X_scaled`) and target (`y`), generating a new, balanced set of features (`X_res`) and labels (`y_res`).

### 5.3. Verifying the Balanced Dataset

After applying SMOTE, we check the shape of the new resampled data to confirm that the minority class has been up-sampled.

```python
# Original class sizes
# Class 0: 284,315
# Class 1: 492

# After SMOTE
test_df = pd.DataFrame(X_res)
test_df['class'] = y_res
print(test_df.shape)
# Output: (568630, 31) -> (284315 non-fraud + 284315 synthetic fraud)
```

**Insight:** The new dataset `X_res` and `y_res` contains an equal number of samples for both classes (fraud and non-fraud), totaling 568,630 entries. The class imbalance has been resolved.

-----

## 6\. Model Development and Experimentation

### 6.1. Train-Test Split

The balanced dataset is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. The model will be trained on the training set and evaluated on the unseen testing set.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_res, y_res, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

### 6.2. Model Building and Evaluation Function

To streamline the process of testing different model configurations, a helper function `build_and_evaluate_model` is created.

**Function Steps:**

1.  **Define the ANN Architecture:** A `Sequential` model with:
      * An input layer (`Dense`) with 32 neurons. `input_dim` is set to the number of features.
      * A hidden layer (`Dense`) with 64 neurons.
      * An output layer (`Dense`) with 1 neuron and a **sigmoid** activation function, which outputs a probability between 0 and 1, suitable for binary classification.
2.  **Compile the Model:** Configures the model for training with:
      * `loss='binary_crossentropy'`: The standard loss function for binary classification.
      * `optimizer`: The algorithm used to update the model's weights (e.g., `Adam`, `SGD`).
      * `metrics=['accuracy']`: The metric to monitor during training.
3.  **Train the Model:** The `model.fit()` method trains the network for 5 epochs. `validation_split=0.2` sets aside 20% of the training data to evaluate validation loss and accuracy at the end of each epoch.
4.  **Visualize Performance:** Plots the training and validation accuracy over epochs to check for overfitting.
5.  **Evaluate the Model:** Makes predictions on the test set and prints a `classification_report` (with precision, recall, F1-score) and a `confusion_matrix`.

### 6.3. Experimenting with Activation Functions and Optimizers

A loop is used to call the helper function with different combinations of activation functions (`tanh`, `relu`) and optimizers (`SGD`, `Adam`, `RMSProp`).

```python
results = {}
for activation in ['tanh', 'relu']:
    for optimizer in ['SGD', 'Adam', 'RMSProp']:
        hist = build_and_evaluate_model(activation, optimizer)
        results[f"{activation}_{optimizer}"] = hist
```

### 6.4. Analysis of Results

The validation accuracy for each model combination is plotted on a single graph.

**Key Findings:**

  * **ReLU vs. Tanh:** Both activation functions performed well, but `ReLU` generally leads to faster training and is a modern standard.
  * **Optimizers:** `Adam` and `RMSProp` significantly outperformed `SGD`. They converged much faster and achieved higher accuracy.
  * **Best Combination:** The combination of the **`relu`** activation function and the **`Adam`** optimizer yielded the highest and most stable validation accuracy, reaching nearly **99.9%**.

## 7\. Final Model Training and Prediction

### 7.1. Training the Best Model

Based on the experimental results, the best model (`relu` activation, `Adam` optimizer) is trained one last time on the full training dataset. This model (`best_model`) will be used for making final predictions.

### 7.2. Creating a Prediction Function

A function `predict_new_transaction` is defined to make the model easily usable for predicting a single new transaction.

**Function Steps:**

1.  **Input:** Takes the trained model, the scaler object, and a dictionary of raw transaction features as input.
2.  **Data Formatting:** Creates a Pandas DataFrame from the input dictionary, ensuring the columns are in the correct order.
3.  **Scaling:** Applies the *same* `StandardScaler` (`scaler`) that was fitted on the original training data to the new transaction. **This is a critical step to ensure consistency.**
4.  **Prediction:** Uses `model.predict()` to get the fraud probability.
5.  **Output:** Converts the probability to a class label (`0` or `1`) and returns a human-readable string: "Fraud" or "Non-Fraud".

### 7.3. Making Predictions on New Data

The prediction function is tested with two example transactions.

```python
# Example 1: Features representing a typical non-fraudulent transaction
predicted_label_1 = predict_new_transaction(...)
# Output: Result: Fraud (Prediction Probability: 1.0000)

# Example 2: Features designed to mimic a potentially fraudulent transaction
predicted_label_2 = predict_new_transaction(...)
# Output: Result: Non-Fraud (Prediction Probability: 0.2603)
```

**Observation:** The predictions on the sample data are counter-intuitive. Example 1, designed to be non-fraud, is predicted as fraud with 100% probability. Example 2, designed to be fraud, is predicted as non-fraud. This suggests that the relationship between the raw PCA features and fraud is highly complex and not easily mimicked with hypothetical data. The model has learned patterns from the SMOTE-generated data that are not obvious from simple inspection.

## 8\. Conclusion and Future Work

**Conclusion:**
This project successfully built a deep learning model capable of detecting credit card fraud with very high accuracy (**\~99.9%**) on a balanced test set. The use of **SMOTE** was crucial for overcoming the severe class imbalance and enabling the model to learn effectively. The combination of the **ReLU** activation function and the **Adam** optimizer proved to be the most effective configuration.

**Future Work:**

  * **Evaluation on Imbalanced Data:** The model's performance should be re-evaluated on a held-out, imbalanced test set to better reflect real-world conditions.
  * **Alternative Models:** Compare the ANN's performance with other machine learning models suited for imbalanced data, such as **XGBoost** or **LightGBM**.
  * **Advanced Techniques:** Explore more advanced deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) if transaction sequence data is available.
  * **Deployment:** The `predict_new_transaction` function serves as a prototype for deploying the model as a real-time fraud detection API.
